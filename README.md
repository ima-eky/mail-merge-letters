# Mail Merge
Mail Merge is a handy feature that incorporates data from text files and allows you to create multiple documents at once, such as letters, as was done in this project, saving you the time and effort of retyping the same format of letter over and over.
- Data is collected from a starting letter(text file)
- Generates a list of names to receive the letters
- Customizes starting letter to fit individual
